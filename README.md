# golang-todolist
A todolist app written in Golang for educational purposes.

I'm writing this application to educate myself with the Go programming language, and to develop an overall structure and style for developing future web applications in Go.

The application will fulfill the following requirements:

**Execution**
* The development environment will listen to a local port, and the production environment will run as an AWS Lambda function.
* Environment variables are read from a .env in the development environment, and entered directly onto the Lambda function in production.

**Functionality**
* CRUD functionality for todo items and todo lists.
