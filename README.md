# golang-todolist
A todolist app written in Golang for educational purposes.

I'm writing this application to educate myself with the Go programming language, and to develop an overall structure and style for developing future web applications in Go.

The application will fulfill the following requirements:

* CRUD functionality for todo items and todo lists.
